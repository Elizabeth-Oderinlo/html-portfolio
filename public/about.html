<h1>About Temi</h1>

<p>Hi there!<BR /> 
  It's Elizabeth but honestly, I'll rather you call me Temi. I'm a UI/UX designer and Web Developer. <BR />
  I enjoy working on projects that necessitate a high level of vision and problem-solving. One of my favorite things to do is research. 
  So, you could say my hobby is "googling" I don't know if that is a valid hobby but it is a skill.</p>

<P>I have a Bachelors's degree in Mass Communication. I enjoy reading, writing, and binge-watching my favorite tv shows. And oh I LOVEEEEE Thai food and I know a spot with the best Thai food in Atlanta.
  When I am not out for brunch, you would find me curled up on the couch reading a book.</P>
